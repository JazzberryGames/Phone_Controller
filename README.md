Phone_Controller
================

Use your phone to control browser-based html5 games!

###Technical Stuff
####High Level Overview
We are going to attempt to use [CocoonJS](https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/) to write for mobile. We like cocoonJS because it's javascript, cross platform, and meant for games. The popular alternative to CocoonJS is Phonegap, but we don't like Phonegap because it's kind of clunky and terrible and the scaling is weird. Plus the development cycle requires time-consuming compilations between testing.

Anyway.

We're also going to try to use [Primus](https://github.com/primus/primus) for real-time communication.
